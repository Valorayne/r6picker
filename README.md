# R6 Picker

A simple tool aiming to help train the thought process behind picking *Rainbow Six Siege* operators (specifically
attackers) based on intel about enemy operators, sites and reinforced walls. For now it's more of an experiment, but it
might prove useful at some point.

## Features

- Supported Operators: **All** except Brava (Y8S1)
- Supported Maps:
    - Bank
    - Bartlett University
- Supported Game Modes:
    - Bomb
    - Hostage
    - Secure Area

## How it works

The app presents the player with the challenge of picking the best operator based on the following, randomly generated
intel:

- Map and objective site
- 4 allied operators
- 2-5 identified enemy operators

The player can take as much time as they want to think through this very important decision - planning their team's
progression through the map - taking possible attack angles, breakable walls and hatches into account.

Eventually, choosing an operator presents the player with the next randomly generated challenge.
